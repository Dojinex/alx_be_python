#Define the variables
length = 10     #the length of the rectangle.
width = 5       #the width of the rectangle.

#Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length × width) and store the result in a variable named area.
area = length * width

#Print the result
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")
